# Mobile Price Prediction

Mobile Price Prediction Using Random Forest

For those who are not able to load the Jupyter Notebook, check out [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/angry-coder-room/Mobile-Price-Prediction/blob/main/MobilePricePrediction.ipynb).

A simple Random Forect Classification model used to predict mobile price range. Initially started off by running a simple classifier multiple times using different estimator each time.
Also worked on improving the accuracy by using hyper parameter tuning technique, Random SearchCV. (Did not improve the accuracy!)
